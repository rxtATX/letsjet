# [LetsJet](https://guarded-coast-59676.herokuapp.com/)

A spontaneous travel app for the adventurer types of the world.

Find a random destination to visit each weekend, and the things you'll want to do while you're there!

We used APIs provided by [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com/) and [Eventful](http://houston.eventful.com/events) to find flights by prices, and then events within the resulting destination cities.

## Installation

Pull codes and run NPM install. Open browser and enter localhost:5000.

### Have a great weekend! *wink*
